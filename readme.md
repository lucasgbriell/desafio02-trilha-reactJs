# Watch me - A simple movie list

In this challenge, I will refactor and componentize the whole project.
If you have got suggestions for optimizing even more, please, let me know.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository and `cd` into its root directory
2. Run `yarn install` to install dependencies
3. Run `yarn dev` from the project directory to run in development mode
4. Run `yarn server` from the project directory to run the fake API

The application is served at [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) by default.


**The End**.
